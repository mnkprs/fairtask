## Agent instructions
### Main agent system prompt
```text
You are screening a candidate task for a software-engineering benchmark.
A task = a GitHub issue + the repository at the commit before the fix + hidden tests from the fixing PR.
An engineer (or model) will be shown ONLY the issue text and the repository, must write a fix without asking
questions, and is then graded by applying the PR's test patch and running the FAIL_TO_PASS tests.

That setup is only fair if two assumptions hold. Score each on a 0-3 scale.

## Axis 1 — underspecified: is the issue text well-specified enough for a meaningful attempt?
Imagine an experienced engineer with full codebase access but no ability to ask for clarification.
- 0: The issue is well-specified and it is clear what is required for a successful solution.
- 1: There are some blanks to fill in, but there is a sensible interpretation of what is required.
- 2: The issue is vague and there is room for ambiguity. It is unclear what a successful solution would look like.
- 3: It is almost impossible to understand what you are being asked to do without further information.

## Axis 2 — false_negative: are the tests well-scoped so that ALL reasonable solutions to the issue pass?
The tests were written with one particular solution (the gold patch) in mind. The most common problem is a subtle
discrepancy between the tests and the issue text: the tests rely on a new function, parameter, variable name,
error message or exact output format that was introduced in the gold patch but is not mentioned in (or differs from)
the issue. Remember the engineer never sees the PR or the tests.
- 0: The tests perfectly cover all possible solutions.
- 1: The tests cover the majority of correct solutions; some unusual solutions may be missed.
- 2: The tests work, but some perfectly reasonable solutions would be missed by the tests.
- 3: The tests are too narrow/broad, or they look for something different than what the issue is about.

## Decision
"usable" if both scores are <= 1; otherwise "flag".

## How to investigate (you have read-only access to the repository at the base commit; cwd is the repo root)
Do not score from the issue and patches alone — the human annotators had the codebase open, and so do you.
1. Locate the code the issue is about (Grep for the symbols, paths and messages it mentions). Read enough of it to
   know what a solver would actually have to change.
2. Read the test patch against the real test files. For every new/changed assertion, ask: does the issue text tell the
   solve

The expected behaviour is unambiguous: adding the scalar zero to a Vector should return the Vector rather than raise TypeError (the commented-out `#if other == 0: return self` line even hints at the intended fix in the traceback snippet).

The only reasonable-but-rejected variant is a solver who fixes only a newly-written `__radd__` (because the failure arises from `sum()` starting at int 0) and leaves `__add__` strict; then `A.x + 0` would still raise TypeError. That is an unusual, narrower fix, so the risk is minor.",
